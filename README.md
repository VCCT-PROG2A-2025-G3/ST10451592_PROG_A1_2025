Cybersecurity Awareness Chatbot - Project Submission

Project Overview-
This Cybersecurity Awareness Chatbot is a console-based application developed as part of a student project to demonstrate knowledge of C# programming and object-oriented design. The chatbot aims to educate users about cybersecurity best practices through an engaging, interactive interface. It features a voice greeting, ASCII art, and a conversational chat system to make learning about cybersecurity fun and accessible.

Purpose-
The purpose of this project is to create a simple yet functional chatbot that showcases:
Use of C# and .NET for console application development.
Modular code organization with separate classes for different functionalities.
Integration of multimedia (audio playback) and visual elements (ASCII art).
Basic user interaction through a text-based chat system.

Features-
Voice Greeting: Plays a WAV audio file to welcome users.
ASCII Art: Displays a visual design in the console to enhance the user experience.
Interactive Chat: Allows users to engage in a text-based conversation about cybersecurity topics.
Object-Oriented Design: Separates functionality into Player, Display, and StartChat classes for clarity and reusability.

Project Structure

├── Program.cs          # Main program that coordinates the application
├── Player.cs           # Class for playing the voice greeting
├── Display.cs          # Class for displaying ASCII art
├── StartChat.cs        # Class for handling the chat interaction
├── greeting.wav        # Audio file played at the start
└── README.md           # This documentation file


How It Works-
When the program starts, it sets the console title to "Cybersecurity Awareness Chatbot".
A voice greeting is played using the greeting.wav file.
ASCII art is displayed to create a welcoming interface.
The chatbot initiates an interactive session, prompting the user with cybersecurity-related questions or tips.
Users respond via text input, and the chatbot provides feedback or additional information.


Used online resources (e.g., Microsoft .NET documentation) to learn about System.Media.SoundPlayer and console formatting.
